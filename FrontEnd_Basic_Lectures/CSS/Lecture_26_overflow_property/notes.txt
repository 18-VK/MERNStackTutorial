CSS Overflow
    Sometimes the content shown is too large to be visible in a single line or division of the website. 
    So, to avoid loss of that information we can use overflow property

The overflow property has the following values:

> visible - Default. The overflow is not clipped. The content renders outside the element's box
> hidden - The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible
> scroll - The overflow is clipped, and a scrollbar is added to see the rest of the content
> auto - Similar to scroll, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary

overflow-x and overflow-y
--------------------------
The overflow-x and overflow-y properties specifies whether to change the overflow of content just horizontally or vertically (or both):
overflow-x specifies what to do with the left/right edges of the content.
overflow-y specifies what to do with the top/bottom edges of the content.
