CSS Positioning
    The CSS positions allow you to precisely control the placement of an element on the web page.
    It helps to determine how elements are placed inside the container element and how they interact with the other elements on the page.
    There are various types of position property values, such as:
        Static(Default)
            -The elements are positioned according to the normal flow of the document.
        Relative
            -Elements are positioned relative to the normal position in the document.
            You can use the top, right, bottom, and left properties to move the element from its original position.
        Absolute-
            Elements are positioned relative to the closest positioned ancestor (parent), which means we need to have a parent element with a positioning other than 'static'.
            Note: An absolutely positioned element is removed from the normal flow.
            
            An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).
            However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves 
            along with page scrolling.
            Note: Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements.
        Fixed -
            Elements are positioned relative to the viewport (screen) and do not move when the page is scrolled.
            This is useful for creating elements like fixed headers or footers.
        Sticky -
            Position sticky is a hybrid between 'relative' and 'fixed'.
            It allows an element to become "stuck" to the top or bottom of its container when scrolling, but it behaves like relative positioning within the container until it reaches a specified offset
