The display Property
----------------------
The display property is used to specify how an element is shown on a web page.
Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is. 
The default display value for most elements is block or inline.
The display property is used to change the default display behavior of HTML elements.

The display Property Values
------------------------------
The display property has many values:
Value	Description
inline	Displays an element as an inline element
block	Displays an element as a block element
contents	Makes the container disappear, making the child elements children of the element the next level up in the DOM
flex	Displays an element as a block-level flex container
grid	Displays an element as a block-level grid container
inline-block	Displays an element as an inline-level block container. The element itself is formatted as an inline element, but you can apply height and width values

Display: none;
---------------
display: none; is commonly used with JavaScript to hide and show elements without deleting and recreating them. 
Take a look at our last example on this page if you want to know how this can be achieved.

Override The Default Display Value
-----------------------------------
As mentioned, every element has a default display value. However, you can override this.
Changing an inline element to a block element, or vice versa, can be useful for making the page look a specific way,
and still follow the web standards.
A common example is making inline <li> elements for horizontal menus

visibility:hidden; also hides an element
------------------------------------------
However, the element will still take up the same space as before. The element will be hidden, but still affect the layout

CSS Multiple Backgrounds
----------------------------
CSS allows you to add multiple background images for an element, through the background-image property.
The different background images are separated by commas, and the images are stacked on top of each other, 
where the first image is closest to the viewer.
The following example has two background images, the first image is a flower (aligned to the bottom and right) and 
the second image is a paper background (aligned to the top-left corner):

#example1 {
  background-image: url(img_flwr.gif), url(paper.gif);
  background-position: right bottom, left top;
  background-repeat: no-repeat, repeat;
}
