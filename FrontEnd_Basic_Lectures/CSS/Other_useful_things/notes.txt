The height and width properties may have the following values:

> auto - This is default. The browser calculates the height and width
> length - Defines the height/width in px, cm, etc.
> % - Defines the height/width in percent of the containing block
> initial - Sets the height/width to its default value
> inherit - The height/width will be inherited from its parent value

Setting max-width
------------------
The max-width property is used to set the maximum width of an element.
The max-width can be specified in length values, like px, cm, etc., or in percent (%) of the containing block, or set to none (this is default. Means that there is no maximum width).
The problem with the <div> above occurs when the browser window is smaller than the width of the element (500px). The browser then adds a horizontal scrollbar to the page.

Using max-width instead, in this situation, will improve the browser's handling of small windows.
