We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

> Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
> Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
> Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
> Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
> Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)

Adjacent Sibling Selector (+)
------------------------------
The adjacent sibling selector is used to select an element that is directly after another specific element.
Sibling elements must have the same parent element, and "adjacent" means "immediately following".
The following example selects the first <p> element that are placed immediately after <div> elements:

General Sibling Selector (~)
----------------------------
The general sibling selector selects all elements that are next siblings of a specified element.
The following example selects all <p> elements that are next siblings of <div> elements: 

div ~ p {
  background-color: yellow;
}

Pseudo-Elements selector
------------------------
A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element.
For example, it can be used to:

> Style the first letter, or line, of an element
> Insert content before, or after, the content of an element

CSS - The ::before Pseudo-element
----------------------------------
The ::before pseudo-element can be used to insert some content before the content of an element.    
The following example inserts an image before the content of each <h1> element:

h1::before {
  content: url(smiley.gif);
}

CSS - The ::after Pseudo-element
----------------------------------
The ::after pseudo-element can be used to insert some content after the content of an element.
The following example inserts an image after the content of each <h1> element:

h1::after {
  content: url(smiley.gif);
}

CSS - The ::selection Pseudo-element
------------------------------------
The ::selection pseudo-element matches the portion of an element that is selected by a user.
The following CSS properties can be applied to ::selection: color, background, cursor, and outline.
The following example makes the selected text red on a yellow background:

::selection {
  color: red;
  background: yellow;
}
