It describes the structure of an element as a rectangular box that has content, padding, a border, and a margin.

Margin Collapse - 
    Top and bottom margins of elements are sometimes collapsed into a single margin that is equal to the largest of the two margins.
    This does not happen on left and right margins! Only top and bottom margins.
