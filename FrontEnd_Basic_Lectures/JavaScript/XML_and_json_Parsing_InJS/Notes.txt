DOMParser
-----------
The DOMParser interface provides the ability to parse XML or HTML source code from a string into a DOM Document.
Note - A lot of browser functionalities, like DOM manipulations or XHR, are not available natively NodeJS because 
       that is not a typical server task to access the DOM - you'll have to use an external library to do that.

XML2JS library
---------------
https://www.npmjs.com/package/xml2js

In this approach, we are using the xml2js library in JavaScript to parse XML data asynchronously. The parseString 
function converts XML into a JavaScript object, enabling easy access to elements for further processing or display.
