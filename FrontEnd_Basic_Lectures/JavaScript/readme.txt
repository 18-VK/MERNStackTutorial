What is Javascript?
---------------------
JavaScript is a programming language initially designed to interact with elements of web pages.
JavaScript allows you to add interactivity to a web page. Typically, you use JavaScript with HTML and CSS to enhance a web page’s functionality

The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.

JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or actually on any device that has a special program called the JavaScript engine.
The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a “JavaScript virtual machine”.

Different engines have different “codenames”. For example:

V8 – in Chrome, Opera and Edge.
SpiderMonkey – in Firefox.


Client-side vs. Server-side JavaScript
------------------------------------------
When JavaScript is used on a web page, it is executed in web browsers, serving as a client-side language.
JavaScript can run on both web browsers and servers. A popular JavaScript server-side environment is Node.js. Unlike client-side JavaScript, 
server-side JavaScript executes on the server and allows you to access databases, file systems, etc.

Note :- The <script> tag can be placed anywhere in the HTML document, whether it's in the <head> , <body> , or even within a <div> \

Where do I put script src in HTML?
------------------------------------
However, it's recommended to add scripts to the bottom of the <body> element because it can improve a webpage's load time. Placing the script tag at 
the top of the HTML document will slow down page load time as the browser will block all other content rendering till the script is executed.
