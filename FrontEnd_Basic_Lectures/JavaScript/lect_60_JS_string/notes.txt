String
----------
The String object is used to represent and manipulate a sequence of characters.
Strings can be created as primitives, from string literals, or as objects, using the String() constructor:

    const string1 = "A string primitive";
    const string2 = 'Also a string primitive';
    const string3 = `Yet another string primitive`;

    const string4 = new String("A String object");

String literals can be specified using single or double quotes, which are treated identically, or using the backtick character `.
with backtick, you can interpolate expressions. 

With template literals, you can avoid the concatenation operator — and improve the readability of your code — by using placeholders 
of the form ${expression} to perform substitutions for embedded expressions:
     console.log(`${a} is less than ${b}`);
