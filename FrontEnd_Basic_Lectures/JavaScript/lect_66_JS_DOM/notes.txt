DOM(Document object model)
---------------------------
DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface that allows us to create, change, or remove elements
from the document. We can also add events to these elements to make our page more dynamic.

The DOM views an HTML document as a tree of nodes. A node represents an HTML element.
The Document Object Model is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an HTML or XML document as a tree
structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document. 
The DOM represents a document with a logical tree.

The W3C Dom standard is divided into three different parts:

>Core DOM – standard model for all document types
>XML DOM – standard model for XML documents
>HTML DOM – standard model for HTML documents

HTML DOM
---------

HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML documents. HTML DOM is a way to represent the webpage in a 
structured hierarchicalway so that it will become easier for programmers and users to glide through the document.
With HTML DOM, we can easily access and manipulate tags, IDs, classes, attributes, or elements of HTML using commands or methods 
provided by the document object.
Using DOM JavaScript we get access to HTML as well as CSS of the web page and can also modify the behavior of the HTML elements.

Why is DOM Required?
HTML is used to structure the web pages and Javascript is used to add behavior to our web pages. When an HTML file is loaded into
the browser, the JavaScript can not understand the HTML document directly. So it interprets and interacts with the Document Object 
Model (DOM), which is created by the browser based on the HTML document.

DOM is basically the representation of the same HTML document but in a tree-like structure composed of objects. 
JavaScript can not understand the tags(<h1>H</h1>) in HTML document but can understand object h1 in DOM.

> Dynamic Web Pages: It allows you to create dynamic web pages. It enables the JavaScript to access and manipulate 
page content, structure, and style dynamically which gives interactive and responsive web experiences.
> Interactivity: With the DOM, you can respond to user actions (like clicks, inputs, or scrolls) and modify the web page accordingly.
> Content Updates: When you want to update the content without refreshing the entire page, the DOM enables targeted changes making the 
web applications more efficient and user-friendly.

BOM(Browser object model)
--------------------------

The Browser Object Model (BOM) is a collection of objects exposed by the browser that allow JavaScript to interact with the browser 
window, document, and other browser-specific functionalities. The BOM includes objects such as Window, Navigator, Location, History, 
and Screen.
The Window object serves as the entry point to the BOM and provides access to the other objects within it.

It is nothing but a pack of objects that allow to control the browser, e.g access browsing history, open a new window, get 
the current page address (URL) and to redirect the browser to a new page etc.
