Array
--------
JavaScript Array is a data structure that allows you to store and organize multiple values within a single variable. 
It is a versatile and dynamic object. It can hold various data types, including numbers, strings, objects, and even other arrays. 
Arrays in JavaScript are zero-indexed i.e. the first element is accessed with an index 0.

>JavaScript arrays are resizable and can contain a mix of different data types. 


Function
--------
map():-
    >creates a new array from calling a function for every array element.
    >does not execute the function for empty elements.
    >does not change the original array.

Syntax :- array.map(function(currentValue, index, arr), thisValue)

function():-Required-A function to be run for each array element.
currentValue:- Required-The value of the current element.
index:- Optional-The index of the current element.
arr:-Optional-The array of the current element.
thisValue:-Optional-Default value undefined.A value passed to the function to be used as its this value.



Map vs filter
-------------
'Map' is used to apply a function on every item in an array and returns the new array. 'Filter' is used to create a new array 
from an existing one, containing only those items that satisfy a condition specified in a function.

Reduce method
--------------
The reduce() method executes a reducer function for array element. The reduce() method returns a single value: 
the function's accumulated result.
