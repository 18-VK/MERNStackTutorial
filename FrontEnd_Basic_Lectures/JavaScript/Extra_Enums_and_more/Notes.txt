Enums in javascript
-------------------
Enums in JavaScript are used to represent a fixed set of named values. They allow developers to define a list of named constants, 
which can be used throughout the codebase to increase code readability, maintainability and prevent errors.
However, Enums are not native to JavaScript, so they are usually implemented using objects or frozen arrays.

Object.freeze() Method: One way to create an Enum-like object is by defining a plain JavaScript object with constant property 
values, and then using Object.freeze() to prevent any further modification. This will ensure that the object and its properties
cannot be changed or mutated. You can use the Object.freeze() method to prevent any changes to the object. Once an object is 
frozen, you cannot add, modify or delete any of its properties. You can use this method to create an immutable object that 
represents your Enum.

Call method
-------------
With the call() method, you can write a method that can be used on different objects.
In JavaScript all functions are object methods.
If a function is not a method of a JavaScript object, it is a function of the global object 

The call() method is a predefined JavaScript method.
It can be used to invoke (call) a method with an owner object as an argument (parameter).
With call(), an object can use a method belonging to another object.
