HTML form - An HTML form is used to collect user input. The user input is most often sent to a server for processing.

The Action Attribute
    The action attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted.
    Usually, the form data is sent to a file on the server when the user clicks on the submit button.

    In the example below, the form data is sent to a file called "action_page.php". This file contains a server-side script that handles the form data:
    Example
        On submit, send form data to "action_page.php":

        <form action="/action_page.php">
        <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
        <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="John"><br>
        <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
        <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Doe"><br><br>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
        </form>

The <form> element is a container for different types of input elements, such as: text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, 
submit buttons, etc.

The Submit Button
------------------
The <input type="submit"> defines a button for submitting the form data to a form-handler.
The form-handler is typically a file on the server with a script for processing input data.
The form-handler is specified in the form's action attribute.

The <fieldset> and <legend> Elements
-------------------------------------
The <fieldset> element is used to group related data in a form.
The <legend> element defines a caption for the <fieldset> element.

The Name Attribute for <input>
-------------------------------
"Notice that each input field must have a name attribute to be submitted."
If the name attribute is omitted, the value of the input field will not be sent at all.

The Target Attribute
----------------------
The target attribute specifies where to display the response that is received after submitting the form.
The target attribute can have one of the following values:

Value	Description
_blank	The response is displayed in a new window or tab
_self	The response is displayed in the current window
_parent	The response is displayed in the parent frame
_top	The response is displayed in the full body of the window
framename	The response is displayed in a named iframe
The default value is _self which means that the response will open in the current window.

The Autocomplete Attribute
--------------------------
The autocomplete attribute specifies whether a form should have autocomplete on or off.
When autocomplete is on, the browser automatically complete values based on values that the user has entered before.
e.g - <form action="/action_page.php" autocomplete="on">

The name attribute 
--------------------
: specifies the name of a form.
The name attribute is used to reference elements in a JavaScript, or to reference form data after a form is submitted.

<form action="/action_page.php" method="get" name="myForm">
   <!-- Data-->
</form>
The Novalidate Attribute
--------------------------
The novalidate attribute is a boolean attribute.
When present, it specifies that the form-data (input) should not be validated when submitted.

<form action="/action_page.php" novalidate>

The Method Attribute
----------------------
The method attribute specifies the HTTP method to be used when submitting the form data.
The form-data can be sent as URL variables (with method="get") or as HTTP post transaction (with method="post").
The default HTTP method when submitting form data is GET.

Notes on GET:

> Appends the form data to the URL, in name/value pairs
> NEVER use GET to send sensitive data! (the submitted form data is visible in the URL!)
> The length of a URL is limited (2048 characters)
> Useful for form submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result
> GET is good for non-secure data, like query strings in Google

Notes on POST:

> Appends the form data inside the body of the HTTP request (the submitted form data is not shown in the URL)
> POST has no size limitations, and can be used to send large amounts of data.
> Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked

Tip: Always use POST if the form data contains sensitive or personal information!
