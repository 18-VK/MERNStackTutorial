Bookmarks
----------
Bookmarks can be useful if a web page is very long.
To create a bookmark - first create the bookmark, then add a link to it.
When the link is clicked, the page will scroll down or up to the location with the bookmark.

e.g
<a href="#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>

<h2 id="C4">Chapter 4</h2>
