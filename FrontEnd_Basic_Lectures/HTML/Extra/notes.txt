<b> tag
--------
The HTML <b> element defines bold text, without any extra importance.

<strong> tag
-------------
The HTML <strong> element defines text with strong importance. The content inside is typically displayed in bold.

<i> tag
----------
The HTML <i> element defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.
Tip: The <i> tag is often used to indicate a technical term, a phrase from another language, a thought, a ship name, etc.

Difference
-----------
<b> and <i> are explicit - they specify bold and italic respectively.
<strong> and <em> are semantic - they specify that the enclosed text should be "strong" or "emphasised" in some way, usually bold and italic, 
but allow for the actual styling to be controlled via CSS. Hence these are preferred in modern web pages.
