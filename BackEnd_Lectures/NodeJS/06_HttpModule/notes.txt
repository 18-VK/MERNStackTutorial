The http module in Node.js is used to create HTTP servers and clients. It provides functionalities for making HTTP 
requests and handling HTTP responses.

Creating an HTTP Server
-----------------------
To create an HTTP server, you need to require the http module and use the createServer method.

Key Methods and Properties
---------------------------
> http.createServer([options][, requestListener]): Creates a new HTTP server instance.
> server.listen(port[, hostname][, backlog][, callback]): Starts the HTTP server listening for connections.
> req.on('data', callback): Adds a listener for the 'data' event. This event is emitted when a chunk of data is available.
> res.writeHead(statusCode[, statusMessage][, headers]): Sends a response header to the request.
> res.end([data][, encoding][, callback]): Signals that the response is complete.

Conclusion
----------
The http module is a fundamental part of Node.js, enabling you to create servers and clients to handle HTTP requests and
responses. It's essential for building web applications and APIs in Node.js. For more advanced features and a higher level
of abstraction, you might consider using frameworks like Express.js built on top of the http module.

Note : Http module's server class has event emitters functionality

There is more thing to do.. but for building APIs we'll use ExpressJs that's why we are not gonna deep down more into it.
