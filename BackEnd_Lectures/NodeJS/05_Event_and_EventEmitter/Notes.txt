In Node.js, the events module provides a way to handle asynchronous events. The core of the events module is the 
EventEmitter class, which allows you to create and manage event-driven architectures. Event emitters facilitate
communication between different parts of your application by allowing one part to emit an event and another part 
to listen for and respond to that event.

meaning of emit : to send out something, for example, a smell, a sound, smoke, heat or light

Basic Concepts
--------------
> EventEmitter Class: This class is used to create and handle custom events.
> Emitting Events: You can emit an event using the emit method.
> Listening to Events: You can listen for an event using the on method.

Conclusion : 
Event emitters in Node.js provide a powerful way to handle asynchronous events, making your code more modular and easier
to manage. They are extensively used in Node.js, including in core modules such as HTTP, Streams, and File System (fs).

Event arguments
---------------
while rasing event we can also pass some data to listener using event arguments
