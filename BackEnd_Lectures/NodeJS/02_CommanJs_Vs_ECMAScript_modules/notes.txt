What is a Module?
-----------------
A module is a self-contained unit of code that encapsulates related functionality. This allows developers to 
organize their code into logical,reusable components. Such components can be easily imported and used in other
parts of their project.

Node.js supports two module systems for organizing and sharing code. These are

> CommonJS modules
> ECMAScript modules
CommonJS modules have been the traditional method for handling dependencies in Node.js, whereas ECMAScript
modules are a newer addition and follow the standard format used in modern browsers.

CommonJS Modules
----------------
The CommonJS module format specifies a way to define a module using a require()function to load modules and 
module.exports or exports object to expose functionality. 

Different ways to configure CommonJS modules
-----------------------------------------------
Following are the ways to configure CommonJS modules in your project:

> Files with a .js extension when the nearest parent package.json file contains a top-level 
field "type" with a value of "commonjs" 

Note : no need to add 'type' also because my default value is type : 'commonjs'
