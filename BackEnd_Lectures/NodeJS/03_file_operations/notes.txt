File Opeartions in nodejs
-------------------------
Node.js provides the functionality to read and write files from the computer. Reading and Writing the 
file in Node.js is done by using one of the coolest Node.js modules called fs module, it is one of the 
most well-known built-in Node.js modules out there.

The file can be read and written in node.js in both Synchronous and Asynchronous ways. A Synchronous method is 
a code-blocking method which means the given method will block the execution of code until its execution is 
finished (i.e. Complete file is read or written). On the other hand, an Asynchronous method has a callback
function that is executed on completion of the execution of the given method and thus allows code to run 
during the completion of its execution. Or according to modern JavaScript, asynchronous methods return a 
Promise which implies the eventual completion of the ongoing asynchronous method, the Promise will either
be resolved or rejected. Thus, it is non-blocking.
